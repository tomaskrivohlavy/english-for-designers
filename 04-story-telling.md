# 04 — STORYTELLING  
*A designer’s perspective on clarity, space and responsibility*

---



## 01 — Who I Am  
I’m a designer working across interior and graphic design.  
I care about form, function and how design shapes everyday experience.

---



## 02 — A Dual Perspective  
I studied both visual communication and spatial design.  
It taught me to think in systems — how things look, how they feel, and how they work.  
I don’t separate identity from space — they reinforce each other.

---



## 03 — What Matters to Me  
Design should serve more than trends.  
I look for long-term solutions that combine clarity, usability and aesthetic value —  
whether it's a visual identity or a retail interior.

---



## 04 — Responsible Choices  
I work with materials that make sense for the context —  
durable, efficient, and when possible, sustainable.  
Good design should be responsible without shouting about it.

---



## 05 — Process and Practice  
Every project starts with understanding people, needs and constraints.  
From there, I design systems — visual or spatial — that support clarity and coherence.

---



## 06 — Identity as System  
Branding isn’t just about logos.  
I create visual identities that are flexible, honest, and aligned with the client's purpose.  
Design is a language — and I focus on fluency.

---


## 07 — Interiors as Experience  
Space is communication in 3D.  
I design environments that reflect identity, support flow, and feel intentional — from layout to lighting.

---



## 08 — With the Client  
Collaboration isn’t just part of the process — it is the process.  
I listen carefully, think critically, and adapt — because every project is different.

---



## 09 — Practice Direction  
I aim to build a design practice rooted in clarity, adaptability and care.  
Whether physical or visual, the work should feel grounded, useful, and human.

---



## 10 — What I Believe  
Design is not decoration.  
It’s structure, decision, atmosphere.  
And when done well, it becomes invisible — because it simply works.
