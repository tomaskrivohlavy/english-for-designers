## 01 — Who I Am  
I’m a designer who thinks in systems, feels in textures,  
and always asks “Why does this matter?”

## 02 — Where I Started  
My curiosity started early:  
obsession with notebooks, surfaces, light.  
I studied both graphic and interior design — but never chose one.

## 03 — My Question  
Can design be responsible?  
Can it be beautiful *and* necessary?  
My work asks: What do we already have — and how can we reuse it?

## 04 — Materials as Message  
I work with recycled textiles,  
modular furniture, unfinished structures —  
materials that carry memory, contradiction, and context.

## 05 — The Studio as Lab  
I see the studio not as a showroom,  
but as a place to test, break, learn.  
Every prototype tells me what not to do next.

## 06 — Design = Dialogue  
My installations invite people to move, rest, reconfigure.  
Good design doesn’t speak loudly. It listens back.

## 07 — Identity Beyond Logo  
Whether it’s space or visual identity,  
I build systems that adapt —  
not just brands, but behaviors.

## 08 — Always Human  
No matter the medium, I design for attention, care, and access.  
My work isn’t just for the eye — it's for the body, too.

## 09 — Where I'm Going  
I’m building a practice where  
aesthetics meet ethics,  
and design becomes part of something bigger.

## 10 — Let’s Rethink Value  
What’s valuable today?  
Maybe not more things — but better systems, better questions,  
and better ways to care.
